# Jiahao Cai

## Who?

Currently Staff Engineer @Google.\
My main theme is *writing code to do something on code*. For example, I write code...
* to generate more code
* to optimize existing code
* to restore source code from compiled/obfuscated shenanigans
* to discover vulnerabilities & identify malicious behavior in code

<summary>2020.06-2023.04: <em>Program analysis & Malware hunting</em> @Google Android Security</summary>

1. Hunted Android malware using *Static Analysis* and *ML*.
2. Worked on *Decompiler* and its large-scale pipeline (it scans all the apps on Google Play per day).
3. Built a *cloud-based web IDE* for reverse engineers to search/navigate/compare decompiled code.
4. I also worked on *semantic code diff*, trying to defeat code obfuscation. *GPT-3.5* blew my mind, I sensed a paradigm shift and changed team.
